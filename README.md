# Eco-Friendly-Agriculture
This project aims to develop an eco-agriculture website that enhances sustainability by providing farmers with tools to efficiently manage vegetable waste and convert it into nutrient-rich fertilizers. The platform offers easy access to educational resources, eco-friendly product listings, nutrient analysis, and community forums. By promoting sustainable practices, improving waste management, and fostering collaboration among farmers and experts, the website helps optimize agricultural operations, turning waste into a valuable resource while supporting environmental goals. The system simplifies tasks like waste processing and nutrient management, making eco-friendly farming practices more accessible and efficient.
